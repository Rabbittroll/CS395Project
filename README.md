  On startup when testing with older android emulators, i get an error retrieving the package edu.cs371m.reddit on startup but not on newer ones.
  On newer Android as well the home as up button populates as an arrow in the top left of the menu. I have tested the system back button in the emulator directly as well and it has the same functionality.
